# Infineon XMC 4700 configuration

This document is a step by step documentation on how to configure a [XMC 4700 relax kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc47_relax_v1/) to drive a 16 channel multiplexer. The XMC 4700 will communicate with a Raspberry Pi with EPICS installed through serial communication. We will replace the Arduino microcontroller that we are using in the prototype with the XMC 4700 for added reliability and fine control. This document provides a guide for
- DAVE Installation
- UART Communication
- LCD Display control
